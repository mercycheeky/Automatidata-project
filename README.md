# Aboutüññ
This was part of the google advanced data analytica program that explored how data professionals operate in the workspace. I also discovered ways in which data professionals contribute to an organization's vision and  explored how data professionals operate in the workplace. I also discovered ways in which data professionals contribute to an organization's vision. Additionally, I learned about the benefits of a workflow in data analysis through PACE (plan, analyze, construct, and execute) and how it can help you navigate the technical and workplace expectations in a career. 
This specific project focuses on the ability to plan for data projects and create a project proposal.
## Background of the project Scenario:
Had to assume that I had been hired as a data analyst at a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client‚Äôs business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 
Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 
The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 
Automatidata is in the earliest stages of the TLC project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:
- A project proposal identifying the following:
   - Organize project tasks into milestones
   - Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
   - Identify relevant stakeholders

## The Assignmentü¶æ
Automatidata will need a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within the TLC project. Not forgetting taking into account my audience, team, project goal, and PACE stages of each task in planning the project deliverable.
